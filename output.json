                "body": "I came across the idea of creating a social network whose purpose it is to connect you with people in your area/neighbourhood. Such a network would also be managed by someone in your neighbourhood and would be aimed at creating in-person connections, making people meet and come together.\n\nSuch a network is the perfect opposite of currently widespread \"social\" network platforms, which mostly aim to engage users online as much as possible, ultimately at the cost of direct interactions. These networks are also centrally controlled and usually come with algorithms that steer conversation into inflammatory directions.\n\nEven the open source and federated alternatives to these platforms often only change the centralised and closed part but still maintain most of the attention-taking design that I don't see as ideal.\n\nIn my vision of a local network (as I will call it for this post), people should be able to find others nearby with similar interests and be supported in meeting up for activities, sharing/exchanging goods or services and more. Creating something like this is tricky, it needs to be very useful and shouldn't become a time sink of its own, however it should still be attractive enough for people to actually want to use it.\n\nDo you have any thoughts or suggestions what are some helpful and necessary features or aspects to keep in mind, and perhaps even more critically, what should not be present?\n\nLooking forward to your thoughts!\n\n---\n\nBonus ideas:\n\n* Such local networks could still federate, so neighbourhood networks could federate on some level to connect larger areas in a city. What should federate, and how far?\n* Local networks can also be hosted on non-internet networks like Freifunk since they are geographically based in a small area. This can also improve resilience of such networks in catastrophic situations.\n* Is there a good way that geographically more spread-out groups of activists, perhaps even in different countries, could make use of such networks? (How) Can this be compatible with keeping it simultaneously locally rooted and local-first?",

I'd rather use the zero or the PC+ since they're kinda unstable/wonky and I don't trust them anymore for stuff I want to keep running 24/7 (like pihole).\n\nI'm open to testing other music servers (volumio maybe?) on my main homelab if that means having the ability to change the client/sink from the app/gui (something like what Spotify does, where you can pick from any client to stream to other clients/speakers)",

                "content": "so you know photography right, doing it in your phone is easy but it pales in comparison to professional quality, and it's mostly not because of the device, for your photo-taking machine to bring meaningful difference you need a certain skill level.\n\nHere's a few tips how to improve dramatically even with just your phone! Manual is great and all but whatever algorithm your phone uses will always give you an ok photo, and you want to take both good and shit photos! Variety is the spice of life after all\n\n- turn on the 3x3 grid on your camera screen. Then try to allign people's eyes, faces etc with the top line horizontal in whatever orientation you use. Objects of interest go along them as well, or even in the bits where they cross. Landscapes look best when you get the horizion running the bottom horizontal line. For more information check out rules of composition\n\nnow photography is all about light, without it there would be no photo after all. Here's the 3 key setting that are fun to mess with:\n\n- go to \"more modes\" or similarly named menu in your camera. Select pro, here a few fun setting will appear \n\n- ISO controls brightness and grain, the bigger ISO the brighter the photo but the more grainy too\n\n- shutter speed control the lenght of exposure to light your photo gets, the longer shutter speed the brighter the photo but the steadier your hands need to be to compensate (with a very long shutter speed you can also take those fun light drawing photos, but that often needs a tripod or some sort of steady spot for your phone)\n\n- f stop, in phones you get maybe one or two options for that but this controls the depth of field and, you guessed it, brightness. The lower the number the more open your lens is and the more light flows in, but your depth of field gets smaller (blurry background)\n\nmost of photography is learning how to balance those 3 settings! All of them have their use, a sports photographer will use much different settings than a studio portait photographer. \n\nthough perhaps the most important rule of photography (and all of art) is that there are no rules, just guidelines, when hearing about a \"rule\" your first thought should be to see what happens when you break it, so then you can understand why it's a \"rule\" and perhaps even think of ways to break it with intent so the critics of the world can go \"ahhh how clever\" at your work :D\n\nI'm not a girl nor autistic (though adhd) but I hope this brings you some fun :3",

                "content": "Libertarianism requires its members to engage in due diligence in order to execute their libertarian ideals properly and make the choices that are correct for them.\n\nThis, unfortunately, excludes the lower-60% of all Americans, who are so ground down, economically terrorized, and mentally overwhelmed with their daily struggles to survive that they have little to no opportunity to approach any major choice with anything even vaguely in the realm of due diligence. They just don\u2019t have the headspace to do so, and are forced to spend all their available mental efforts on just putting one financial foot in front of the other.\n\nThis is why having social support frameworks enforced/provided/funded by the government is so important for so many working-class people - it allows them to put those issues on autopilot, significantly reducing their own cognitive load and allowing them to better process the most important issues in their lives.\n\nErgo, libertarianism is a wealthy person\u2019s toy. It is something that they can champion, _because only they have the economic options and financial freedom to fully and properly engage with it._\n\nUntil everyone has vanishingly few catastrophic-level issues on the horizon (like one missed paycheque leading to homelessness, or a sudden illness leading to medical bankruptcy), any attempt to implement libertarianism will only bring mass amounts of misery and destroyed lives to anyone beneath the Parasite Class.\n\nAnd when you have those kinds of widespread government-provided supports that lift _all_ boats - and not just the megayachts - why bother with libertarianism? We should continue to use what got everyone into that safe state in the first place -- socialism.\n\nRemember, the Parasite Class already uses socialism for themselves. It\u2019s called grants and bailouts and subsidies, and allows the Parasite Class to privatize the profits and socialize the losses.\n\nIt\u2019s just at a scale that makes it impossible for working-class people to leverage.",

According to the specs sheet it shouldn't be, but for some reason it is noticeably lighter than a friend of mine's MacBook Air 2021.\n\nWhat I really love about it is the ThinkDock Ultra (iirc 30$ on ebay), which lets me place the laptop on my table, and by just sliding a piece of plastic, it connects all of my peripherals in a second. I love this laptop so much that I'll use it until it dies so hard that it can't be fixed at all.\n\n![laptop, cover](https://programming.dev/pictrs/image/31a76362-fcf6-493c-9a04-86c98a2b6ea0.jpeg)\n![laptop, open](https://programming.dev/pictrs/image/84c15114-b68c-4d9c-ab65-ac1a994d2a4c.jpeg)\n![dock, no laptop](https://programming.dev/pictrs/image/709c8e68-f261-4a8d-9ebf-f0143f01e00b.jpeg)\n![dock, I/O](https://programming.dev/pictrs/image/8bd635f4-793c-44a1-8f52-12f0ca7b2034.jpeg)\n![laptop + dock](https://programming.dev/pictrs/image/c69ed1d0-ae82-4d18-b077-f028a5196120.jpeg)",

If what Hamas says is true then the hospital would have to be using 5.7 MW of power. \n\n\nI compared this with the state of Victoria (pop. 6.7M) Australia where the hospitals in *total* use 147MW of power. In non-wartime that Gazan hospital probably serves about ten times fewer people, which would be 14.7MW.

                "body": "So I've recently taken an interest in these three distros:\n\n- [NixOS](NixOS)\n- [blendOS](https://blendos.co/)\n- [Vanilla OS](https://vanillaos.org/)\n\nAll of these offer something very interesting:  \nAccess to (basically) all Linux-capable software, no matter from what repo.\n\nBoth *NixOS* and *blendOS* are based on config files, from which your system is basically derived from, and Vanilla OS uses a package manager `apx` to install from any given repo, regardless of distribution.\n\nWhile I've looked into *Fedora Silverblue,* that distro is limited to only install Flatpaks (edit: no, not really), which is fine for \"apps\", but seems to be more of a problem with managing system- and CLI tools.\n\nI haven't distro hopped yet, as I'm still on [Manjaro GNOME](https://manjaro.org/) on my devices.\n\n---\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the three distros mentioned above?  \nWhich ones are the most interesting, and for what reasons?\n\nPersonally, I'm mostly interested in NixOS &amp; blendOS, as I believe they may have more advantages compared to Arch;\n\nWhat do you think?",

I think it was released about 2016.\n   \nEven if it shows a lot of signs of wear, it is still a very good device. I received it with Windows 11, but of course I didn't want use it like that. 4 gigs of ram aren't enough for that anyway. \n   \nSo I installed Fedora. (Had to rename the uefi boot entry for it to boot from disk. This is described elsewhere online but if you read this post and wonder how to do it, please dm me and I'll be happy to help.)\n   \nNow this is my primary device for when I'm away from my desktop PC. Gnome is stunning on 2-in-1s IMO, *much* better than Windows would ever be. \n   \nHardware wise everything works just fine out of the box, apart from the rear camera which isn't recognized, but I wouldn't use that anyway. \n   \nHonestly, the Switch Alpha 12 is the poor man's MS Surface and I think it's a shame that Acer has apparently given up on this device class. For now I'm happy to use this pc for as long as I can. ",

                "body": "Houses require maintenance. How much and how often depends on the design and its surroundings. They also require occupants - in my brief experience at least, they degrade much faster when they\u2019re left cold and empty than when someone lives there, even if that someone doesn\u2019t fix things. Weather, encroaching water, mold, ice, and animals can all cause compounding damage surprisingly fast.\n\nI think of the solarpunk society I've been depicting as being post-postapoclyptic. They\u2019ve been through the worst of the climate crisis, wars, plagues, and all kinds of shortages, and they\u2019re trying to rebuild better.\nIn some of my previous postcards, I\u2019ve tried to imagine what the rural communities I grew up in would look like transformed into a modern version of how they looked a hundred years ago, with denser villages, trains, and wide stretches of forests and farmland in between. They were set up this way back when because it was practical for people who walked or relied on horse carts to get around day-to-day, and who traveled to use a boat or a steam train for a longer trip. A solarpunk society that doesn\u2019t want to rebuild the infrastructure(s) to produce and maintain personal vehicles, fuel them, and to drive them on, might have to look pretty similar out here.\n\nBut what happens to the houses and developments spattered across the land between those villages? Every road with a house a quarter mile from its nearest neighbor, now miles from those hubs of public transit? In a society where public transit is effective, and cars are rare, I think a lot of roads will degrade pretty quickly. They already need tons of maintenance, and that\u2019s with people using them every day, totally dependent on them, grudgingly agreeing to pay for it. It\u2019s not uncommon to live thirty minutes or an hour from your grocery store today, but on badly broken roads, that kind of travel is going to be more difficult and costly. Some people will do it, heck, some will have held out through all the bad times and will stay no matter what else changes. But I suspect a lot of houses will have been abandoned a long time ago.\n\nThere\u2019s tons of embodied carbon stored in those structures. In their carefully-refined materials, their transportation, and in the act of construction. Some of those materials might be very difficult to produce for a society that carefully watches its externalities and seeks to do as little harm as possible. And the longer they\u2019re left abandoned, the more they\u2019ll degrade. The structures will become unsafe, the materials will rot or break, or become inaccessible, and in some cases, they\u2019ll pose environmental risks as fuel tanks rust out, chemicals escape their storage, or damaged structures catch fire (even with the powerlines cut upstream, abandoned solar panels or poorly-isolated generators backfeeding into the grid might allow for damage to an abandoned house to cause a fire). This is especially true with modern buildings, particularly the kind of [McMansion](https://mcmansionhell.com/) featured in the scene, with their heavy reliance on petro-products like \u201cstructural\u201d foam columns and facades, which will go up like a struck match in the next wildfire.\n\nIn some cases, old buildings could be put back into use. Perhaps they\u2019re nearby something the rebuilding society needs. Maybe one development will make for a good farming community, and another the barracks of a logging camp. Maybe one near a river can support trade or fishing. But there will be others that are simply not very useful. They were practical enough for semi-suburban life when gas was cheap, cars were plentiful, and roads were maintained. But in a world where most people have other priorities, live in closer communities, use public transportation, and aren\u2019t interested in rebuilding a car-centric world, these houses don\u2019t make sense. And of course there's the ones in unsafe locations (flood plain, unstable/eroding cliff, etc) where they won\u2019t last no matter what. \nTo that society, deconstruction might be a very practical answer to both the long term threat posed by these structures and to their own building material needs.\n\n[Deconstruction](https://www.epa.gov/large-scale-residential-demolition/reuse-and-recycling-opportunities-and-demolition) is an alternative to home demolition. It means carefully [dismantling the constructed components of a house so the materials can be salvaged and reused](https://www.morrishabitat.org/programs/deconstruction). Materials are typically removed in the opposite order in which they were installed, to maximize reuse.\n\nBy carefully disassembling these structures and hauling the materials back to their communities, they can build and expand for a much lower overall cost (both environmentally and in resources harvested from the world) while removing potential toxin or fire threats. And by filling in their cellarholes and replanting, they can rewild developed land, build better habitats, and restore their local ecosystems.\n\nOn top of that, even buildings picked over by looters may be full of usable stuff - furniture, dishes, cooking tools, hardware - which a society with an interconnected library economy could use to meet its needs without producing new items.\n\nSo that\u2019s what I\u2019ve tried to depict here, a deconstruction crew carefully disassembling old world structures so that everything, from the windows to the metal roof panels, to the cabinets to the stick framing itself, can be reused elsewhere rather than produced new.\n\nThey\u2019ve been working from left to right in this scene, taking each house apart in reverse order to how it was built. Much as with construction, this would require different crews of specialists: inspectors, roofers, carpenters, electricians, plumbers, and others who can safely remove resources without doing unnecessary damage. Once a crew finishes their part of a building, they\u2019d hopefully be able to move on to another one nearby.\n\nThey\u2019re also replanting/rewilding the old backfilled foundations, something that would certainly help with breaking up the concrete (eventually). Roots are great at that.\n\nI\u2019m not sure if it\u2019d be worthwhile to use concrete saws to cut at least some of the concrete foundations into construction blocks. It\u2019d certainly help with restoring the site quicker, and it\u2019d be a low-ish carbon source for concrete blocks, but the tradeoffs in labor, transportation, and power for the saw might not be worth it. In that case, they\u2019d probably crack it up with a jackhammer before filling it back in.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of vehicles in this scene, so I should emphasize that these aren\u2019t daily drivers. These are equipment used to haul work crews and construction materials on fairly short trips.\n\nAll the big trucks in the scene are old internal combustion engine vehicles [converted to run on woodgas](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2010/01/wood-gas-vehicles-firewood-in-the-fuel-tank/). I imagine they burn a lot of the wooden construction debris which were otherwise too small or damaged to be worth salvaging. Perhaps some trucks are even set up with [plastic de-refineries](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2023/11/plastic-waste-in-the-fuel-tank/) and are able to use astroturf lawns, broken plastic siding, or \u201cstructural\u201d foam facades as fuel on their trips. This isn\u2019t perfect: it still produces pollution and releases CO2, but if the goal is to salvage as much material as possible, and to prevent it from burning pointlessly in the next wildfire, I could still see an aspirational society accepting that use of it.\n\nAs a bonus, woodgas vehicles are often used as generators, so they may be able to serve that role part-time on-site, powering lights and air pumps for confined spaces like basements, and even certain tools. Otherwise they\u2019d probably use portable solar panels.\n\nThe other (smaller) vehicles are electric minitrucks and rickshaws. \n\nI imagine that the workers are a mix of specialized crews brought in by the larger community for the scheduled deconstruction, and local volunteers who are working for trade in recovered materials. I imagine a lot of the cargo bikes, [Chinese wheelbarrows](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/2011/12/how-to-downsize-a-transport-network-the-chinese-wheelbarrow/), rickshaws, and minitrucks belong to them. I figure in place of real roads, the really small villages and isolated homesteads maintain a surprisingly dense web of rough trails suitable for mountain bikes or snowmobiles, which connect to all their neighbors.\n\nLast art thoughts: I have another scene of a golf course and its surrounding McMansions turned into a solarpunk intentional community that I\u2019d like to do, but the scope on that one is big enough it\u2019ll be awhile before I can get to it. At this point, I\u2019m confident I\u2019ll make it though. McMansions, with their pointless, wasteful scale, their cheap construction, their reliance on petro-product materials, and their often vain attempt to spend their way to classiness, seem kind of like the antithesis of solarpunk design to me. Golf courses with their endless, expensive-to-maintain grass monocrop hold a similar, though less severe place in my mind.\n\nIf you read all that, thank you! And if you\u2019re a person who owns a building in real life, and you\u2019re thinking about doing some renovations, please consider reaching out to your local chapter of Habitat for Humanity or another group who will do deconstruction, rather than just smashing everything up and throwing it away.",

I know it has been a long time I have not made any announcements, but I will try my best next time this doesn't happen again.\n\nSo, through the medium of this post I would like to share with you all the `v1.15.0` major release version of the `websurfx` project which was released on the 25th of March.\n\nIf you are new, and you don't know what is `websurfx` then I would suggest taking a look at my previous post here: \n\nhttps://programming.dev/post/2678496\n\nWhich covers in depth about what the project is and why it exists.\n\n## Credits\n\nBefore I share with you the `changelog`, what this release version means and a preview on what we are planning to work on for the next major release `v2.0.0`. I would first like to thank all our contributors and maintainers because of whom this was all possible. Specially I would like to thank [spencerjibz](https://github.com/spencerjibz), [ddotthomas](https://github.com/ddotthomas) and [evanyang1](https://github.com/evanyang1) who have been invaluable to the project. Also, `Websurfx` would not have been possible without [alamin655](https://github.com/alamin655) and [xffxff](https://github.com/xffxff) early involvement.\n\n![](https://programming.dev/pictrs/image/3baba397-2c61-4f2f-b90a-fefcab4eee59.webm)\n**Thanks \ud83d\udc96 to all the people involved in the project**\n\nNow, let's dive straight into what this release version actually means.\n\n## What does this release version means\n\nThis new release version `v1.15.0` introduces the new ranking algorithm for search results on the search page which ranks the results based on the relevancy to the user's search query. \n\n## Changelog\n\nThe changelog of all the changes can be found here: \n\nhttps://github.com/neon-mmd/websurfx/releases/tag/v1.15.0\n\n## Preview of the goals for the next major release\n\n- Different levels of privacy to choose from with the help of rust's conditional compiling features (**In progress**).\n- Even more engines will be supported.\n- Categories would be added to search results like images, news, etc.\n- More themes will be provided by default\n- More animations for the websurfx frontend will be supported.\n- Multi language support would be added.\n- I2p and tor support will be provided.\n- Reduce animations would be added for those who don't want animations and effects on the frontend.\n- And lots more \u2728.\n",

My name is Victoria and I have worked on a Wayland compositor library called \"smithay\" for the past 5 years. \nRight now I am working for system76 on their new desktop environment, I am member of wayland-protocols and have been contributing to the wider ecosystem. So if you even wanted to learn about the wayland ecosystem and linux desktops, I can and will try to do my best to explain. Even better, I want to give you a reason to use this technology for your projects! \nThe Talk is roughly divided into two parts: First off the background, to get everybody on the same page - What exactly is wayland? - How is it different from X11 in the most important ways? - Technical details! Or how a modern linux desktop is build! - We'll be talking about the \"Direct Rendering Manager\", \"EGL\", \"libinput\", \"Client-side-decorations?\", \"nvidia?!\", \"WSL?!?\" You name it! - THE Showcase! Hopefully you'll understand a lot about the stack now, but you have no idea what to use it for or feel like nothing of it is relevant for you work? Don't be deceived, people use wayland in embedded and automotive applications, for automated testing and continuous integration, for virtualization, XR Applications, Game streaming, Remote Computing, ...! \nLet me show you, what weird things did people build with it and let's unlock more of its potential together!\u201d",

Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution (or distro for short).\n\nDistributions include the Linux kernel and supporting system software and libraries, many of which are provided by the GNU Project. Many Linux distributions use the word \"Linux\" in their name, but the Free Software Foundation uses the name GNU/Linux to emphasize the importance of GNU software, causing some controversy.\n\n\n### Rules\n* Posts must be relevant to operating systems running the Linux kernel.
